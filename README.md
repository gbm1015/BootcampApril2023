# VBA Homework Solution: The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

In this homework assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

### Before opening the homework spreadsheet and coding in VBA

1. I created a new repository in GitHub for this project called `VBA-challenge`. 

2. Inside the new repository that I created, I

	- added the Excel Spreadsheet "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx", that included the stock data to be used for analysis.

	- added the Macro Enable Excel Spreadsheet and VBA Macro "Multiple_year_stock_data_solution.xlsm", that I used for this assignment's solution.

	- uploaded the screenshots of the solution worksheets, for each of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.  

	- uploaded the main VBA script to run the analysis in 3 different extension files; .bas, .txt, and .vba


### Files including data used for analysis and the solution output

* [Stock Data](Multiple_year_stock_data_solution.xlsm) - Ran scripts on this data to generate the final solution output.  

### VBA Scripting file versions; in .bas, .txt, .vba

Module1.bas

Multiple_year_stock_data_solution.txt

Module1.vba

### Stock Market Analyses screenshots

## Analysis Steps

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and generated output for the following information:
  * The ticker symbol.
  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The total stock volume of the stock.

Used conditional formatting that highlighted positive yearly change in green and negative yearly change in red.

Added functionality to the script to return the stock ticker with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

Made the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.
